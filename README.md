Project: PomTimer Web Application

## Description:

Developed a Pomodoro timer web application named PomTimer, hosted on Vercel.
Utilized the Pomodoro technique to help users manage their time efficiently by breaking work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.
Technologies Used:

Front-End: React.js, TasilwindCSS, HTML5
Deployment: Vercel for seamless CI/CD

## Key Features:

Timer Functionality: Implemented a fully functional Pomodoro timer with customizable work and break intervals.
User Interface: Designed an intuitive and responsive user interface to enhance user experience across devices.
State Management: Utilized React hooks for efficient state management and component lifecycle handling.


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
